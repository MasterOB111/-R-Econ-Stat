# Your turn 

Let's work with a dataset from one of your classmates project in Fall 2018.  

* Load the UN data into a new Rmarkdown document Assignment2
* View this data
* Which format is it? (long)
* What will be the ideal format for you to analyse this data in your project (wide)
* Change the format to that ideal format 
* Show the structure of your dataset and head()

```{r}
UN_ExampleTidy <- read.csv("~/Documents/S19_Eco220L/UN_ExampleTidy.csv")
UN_wide <- spread(UN_ExampleTidy, Subgroup, Value)
head(UN_wide)
```
